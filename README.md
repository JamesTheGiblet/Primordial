# 🎨 Primordial

An evolutionary art engine that uses genetic algorithms to create unique digital artworks through natural selection. Experience the birth of digital life as abstract art evolves before your eyes!

> 🌟 **New here?** **[→ START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** - Perfect introduction with guided pathways!

## What It Does

Primordial evolves populations of digital organisms (genomes) that represent abstract artworks. Each genome contains:

- **Colors** - Hue, saturation, lightness palettes
- **Shapes** - Circles, rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs
- **Movements** - Rotation, translation, pulsing animations
- **Parameters** - Complexity, symmetry, rhythm, density

Through tournament selection, crossover, and mutation, these genomes compete for survival based on aesthetic fitness criteria.

## 📸 What It Looks Like

### Dark Theme (Default)

Rich, vibrant gradients with deep blacks create a dramatic canvas for evolution:

- Gradient background: Deep blue → Red → Gold
- Glass-morphism panels with blur effects
- High contrast for optimal viewing

### Light Theme

Soft, pastel tones create a gentle, professional aesthetic:

- Gradient background: Light blue → Pink → Cream  
- Semi-transparent white panels
- Easy on the eyes for extended use

### Key Visual Elements

- **🎨 Real-time Canvas** - Watch genomes render as they evolve
- **📊 Evolution Charts** - Track fitness progress over generations
- **🏆 Hall of Fame Gallery** - Showcase of your best evolved art
- **⚡ Loading Animation** - Beautiful spinner with progress updates

## 🌟 Origin Story

Originally built in approximately 4 hours on a mobile device using HTML editor apps, Primordial has evolved into a sophisticated evolutionary art platform.

**Recent Evolution (October 2025):**

- Professional UI/UX enhancements
- Modern theme system implementation  
- Advanced export capabilities
- Power user keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced social media integration

Because sometimes the best projects come from boredom... and then grow into something beautiful.
