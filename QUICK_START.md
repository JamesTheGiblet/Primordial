# ⚡ Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Primordial in under 5 minutes!

## 🚀 Step 1: Launch the Application

### Option A: Local File

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Wait for the beautiful loading animation to complete

### Option B: Local Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Primordial

# Start a local server (Python)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js
npx http-server

# Open browser to http://localhost:8000
```

> 💡 **Why use a server?** Some features work better with proper HTTP headers and avoid CORS issues.

- Starred genomes go to your "Hall of Fame"
- Build a collection of your best evolution results

### Export Options

- **S key** or **"Save PNG"** - Download current best as image
- **V key** or **"Save SVG"** - Export as scalable vector graphics
- **"Export Hall of Fame"** - Download all your favorites as ZIP

## 🎮 Step 4: Experiment & Explore

### Try Different Environments

Click the environment buttons to change selection pressure:

- **🎯 Balanced** - Well-rounded artistic evolution
- **⚖️ Symmetry** - Geometric, ordered patterns  
- **🌪️ Chaos** - Wild, complex compositions
- **🎨 Minimalist** - Clean, simple aesthetics
- **🌿 Organic** - Natural, flowing forms

### Adjust Parameters

Use the sliders to fine-tune evolution:

- **Mutation Rate** - How much genomes change (try 0.1-0.3)
- **Population Size** - More genomes = more diversity (try 20-50)
- **Tournament Size** - Selection pressure (try 3-5)

## 🧬 Step 5: Manual Breeding (Advanced)

### Create Custom Offspring

1. **Select Multiple Genomes** - Click to select 2+ genomes
2. **Click "Create Offspring"** - Manually cross-breed them
3. **Compare Results** - See genetic differences
4. **Breed Selectively** - Guide evolution toward your preferences

## ⌨️ Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Evolution Progress** - See changes generation by generation

### Control Panel (Right Side)

- **Evolution Controls** - Start, stop, reset buttons
- **Environment Selection** - Change fitness criteria
- **Parameter Sliders** - Fine-tune evolution settings
- **Gallery** - Current generation thumbnails
- **Hall of Fame** - Your starred favorites

### Charts Section

- **Fitness Tracking** - Best/average/worst over time
- **Population Health** - Diversity and convergence metrics

## 🚨 Common First-Time Questions

### "Nothing is happening!"

- Make sure Auto-Evolve is ON (button should be disabled)
- Try pressing SPACE to manually evolve
- Check that the loading screen has finished

### "Art looks boring"

- Try different environments (Chaos for wild results)
- Increase mutation rate (0.3+ for more variety)
- Let it run longer - good art takes time!

### "Can't see my saved files"

- Check your browser's Downloads folder
- PNG files are named with timestamps
- SVG files are vector graphics (open in browser/Illustrator)

### "Want to share results"

- Use Export Hall of Fame for batch download
- SVG files are perfect for printing
- Share the URL - rich meta tags create beautiful previews

## 🎯 Quick Experiments to Try

### 1. The Chaos Challenge (2 minutes)

1. Switch to **Chaos** environment
2. Set mutation rate to **0.5**
3. Click Auto-Evolve and watch explosions of complexity
4. Save the wildest results!

### 2. The Minimalist Journey (3 minutes)

1. Switch to **Minimalist** environment
2. Set mutation rate to **0.1**
3. Watch as simple, elegant forms emerge
4. Notice how less can be more

### 3. The Breeding Experiment (5 minutes)

1. Let a population evolve for 10+ generations
2. Star 3-4 very different genomes
3. Use manual breeding to cross them
4. See what unexpected combinations emerge

### 4. The Theme Explorer (1 minute)

1. Start in dark mode with Organic environment
2. Let some art evolve
3. Switch to light mode (press T)
4. Notice how the same art feels different

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **📋 Read [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md)** - Discover all advanced features
2. **🧪 Experiment** - Try different parameter combinations
3. **🎨 Build Collections** - Create themed Hall of Fame galleries
4. **🔬 Study Patterns** - Notice what environments produce what art styles
5. **🌐 Share** - Export and share your evolutionary masterpieces

## 💡 Pro Tips for Best Results

### For Beautiful Art

- **Let it run** - Good evolution takes 20+ generations
- **Use Balanced** - Best general-purpose environment
- **Medium mutation** - 0.2-0.3 for good variety without chaos
- **Star frequently** - Build a diverse Hall of Fame

### For Interesting Experiments  

- **Try extremes** - Very high/low mutation rates
- **Switch environments** - Mid-evolution environment changes
- **Manual breeding** - Direct the evolutionary process
- **Parameter sweeps** - Try all tournament sizes, population sizes

### For Professional Results

- **Use SVG export** - Scalable vector graphics
- **Light theme** - Better for presentations
- **Hall of Fame** - Curate your best work
- **Batch exports** - Download entire collections
