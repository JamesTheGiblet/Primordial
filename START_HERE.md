## 🎯 Success Tips

### **For Your First Session:**

1. **Give it time** - Good art takes 20+ generations
2. **Try different environments** - Each creates unique styles
3. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Much faster than clicking
4. **Star favorites** - Build your personal gallery
5. **Export as SVG** - Vector graphics scale beautifully

### **For Best Results:**

- **Balanced environment** + **medium mutation** = reliable beauty
- **Chaos environment** + **high mutation** = wild experimentation
- **Manual breeding** + **patience** = directed evolution

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

**"Nothing is happening"** → Make sure Auto-Evolve is ON or press SPACE

**"Art looks boring"** → Try Chaos environment with higher mutation rate

**"Where are my files?"** → Check Downloads folder, files are timestamped

**"Want to share"** → Use Export Hall of Fame or individual SVG exports
